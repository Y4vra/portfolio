# What is this

This is a simple way for me to showcase to the internet my previous projects, as well as a primary introduction to Astro web pages.

## About the project

This portfolio is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site builder that allows you to create fast and optimized websites using your favorite frameworks and tools. The goal is to have a clean, minimalistic place to display my work and provide some context about who I am and what I do.
