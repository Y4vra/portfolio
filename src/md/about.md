# About me

Hi! I'm Javier. I’m a Software Engineering student based in Oviedo. My approach is rooted in the belief that software should be predictable for clients and sustainable for developers.

My main focus lies in Software Development, Cybersecurity, and Team Management, opting for an adaptive methodology that fits the specific needs of the project. I thrive in collaborative environments where clear communication and secure design lead to successful, long-term outcomes for both the client and the team.
